## üßÆ The Problem

Working with multiple number systems (binary, decimal, hex, octal) and bitwise operations can be tedious and error-prone. Common pain-points include:

- Mistakes converting between bases  
- Time-consuming manual calculation of bit shifts or masks  
- Lack of unified, intuitive UI for base-specific operations  
- Steep learning curve for newcomers in systems programming  

---

## üí° Our Solution

DevRay provides a streamlined, feature-rich base-conversion calculator that addresses these issues. Key functionalities include:

- **Multi-Base Conversion**: Instantly convert numbers between binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal.  
- **Operand Size Control**: Define bit-width (8, 16, 32, 64) for accurate hardware-level operations.  
- **Clean UI**: Intuitive and responsive, designed for rapid developer use.

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Architecture & Tech Stack
- Front-end: **[Specify language/framework]** _(TBA)_  
- Logic engine: Implements base conversion
- Operand size switching and bit-masking support  
- Input validation: Recognizes valid digits for each base  
- Output display shows aligned values in desired  base (either binary, octal, decimal or hex)  

### Key Features
- Real-time conversion: Enter a value in one base, see it in all others  
- Operand-size selection: Choose 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit operations  
- Clear error handling and input restrictions for each base  

---

## üé® UI/UX Design Principles
- Developer-friendly layout: Code-style fonts, clear base labels  
- Dark mode (TBA) for reduced eye strain during long coding sessions  
- Minimal learning curve: Focus on usage, not settings  
- Responsive design: Works on desktop and portable devices

## üìä Feature Breakdown

### 1. Multi-Base Conversion
- Enter number in any supported base (e.g., `0x1A`, `0b10110`, `045`)  
- Instant display of equivalent any of desired ba

### 2. Operand Size & Masking
- Dropdown to select bit-width  
- Display shows value as unsigned and signed (two‚Äôs complement) where applicable

## üìà Why DevRay Stands Out
- Tailored for programmers, not just generic calculators  
- Combines base conversion + bitwise operations in one UI  
- Supports custom operand sizes (hardware level)  
- Clean and focused interface, avoiding bloat

## üì¶ Installation & Setup
``` Run this on your Terminal
git clone https://github.com/054mimi/developer
cd developer
# Install dependencies (if applicable)  
npm install  
# Run development build  
npm run dev  
# Build for production  
npm run build
```
for mobile devices:
open the link https://converter-core.lovable.app on your device
if you use chrome as your browser:
find the 3 dots at the top right f your browser
select the option "Add to Desktop"
confirm install
run the app from your device.

NOTE: By default, a pop up should appear at the top of your 
browser window asking to install the app, confirm.

if you use brave:
open the same link on your mobile device
find the 3 dots, probably at the bottom right
click "Add to desktop"
confirm installation.

Boomüí•, your converter calculator is ready for use.
